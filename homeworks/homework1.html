    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p><em>What is statistics, and why can it be useful for cybersecurity?</em></p>
    <h2>Answer</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        Statistics is the branch of mathematics dedicated to the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It provides a framework for making sense of large and complex datasets, allowing us to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions even in the presence of uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        In cybersecurity, statistics plays a fundamental role because digital environments generate vast amounts of data—such as network traffic logs, authentication attempts, and system events—where malicious activities are often hidden among legitimate operations. Statistical techniques enable professionals to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Detect anomalies:</strong> By establishing baselines of normal behavior, statistical models can identify deviations that may indicate cyber attacks, such as unusual login times, abnormal data transfers, or spikes in failed access attempts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assess risk:</strong> Statistical analysis helps quantify the likelihood and potential impact of different threats, supporting risk management and prioritization of security measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluate effectiveness:</strong> Security controls and policies can be tested and improved by analyzing statistical evidence of their performance, such as reduction in incident rates or false positives in intrusion detection systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predict future events:</strong> Using predictive models, cybersecurity teams can anticipate emerging threats or trends, enabling proactive defense strategies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, machine learning algorithms—many of which are grounded in statistical theory—are widely used to classify emails as spam or legitimate, detect malware, and identify phishing attempts. Without a solid understanding of statistics, it would be difficult to design, interpret, or trust these automated systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, statistics empowers cybersecurity professionals to transform raw data into actionable intelligence, making it an indispensable tool for protecting digital assets in an ever-evolving threat landscape.
